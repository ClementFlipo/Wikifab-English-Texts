<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle-first">A non profit for the Open Source economy</h2>

We want to have the most transparent and open organization possible. We want to provide the world with the proper know-how to make anything and make a small contribution to the emerging citizen-economy of open hardware.

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">Economic Model</h2>

Wikifab hosts content with economic potential, but the platform is not intended to advertize or monetize this content. Our advert-free ethos is a vital part of the project because it gives us complete independence of manufacturers and brands, guaranteeing the neutrality of our tutorials.

Many in the tech sector make big profits in ways that often seem unfair to the people who build and use those platforms, we are committed to transparency so that our users can help ensure this doesn't happen to Wikifab.

The Wikifab software is developed collaboratively. The source code is released under an open source license and becomes a common good. Members support the organization with donations and volunteer participation in the design of the software and operation of the site.

If the resources of the organization are not sufficient to secure its financial sustainability, the founders of Wikifab may commercialize services based on the Wikifab software (on the understanding that it will always remain open-source). This marketing approach will be done via a third party structure (independent of Wikifab) that does not threaten the free nature of Wikifab.

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">Resources</h2>

The resources of the organization are :
* Donation
* Public funding
* Benefits from economics activities such as merchandise (T-shirts, Pins, etc.) and event organization.

All profit from economic activities will be reinvested in Wikifab. If financial resources are eventually sufficient, the organization might employ staff.

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">Software exploitation by a third party</h2>

If individuals or cooperatives wish to sell Wikifab software, they are free to do so, although modifications of the Wikifab software have to be licensed under the open source license CC-AA.
