## How to pick the perfect name for your tutorial

For the sake of consistency and search optimization, take the time to think about the name of your tutorial:

###1. If your tutorial concerns the fabrication of an object:

##### 1.1 Enter the name of the object directly. Do not precede the name with an article (a, the).

* Do: Wood table
* Don't: A wood table

##### 1.2 Do not start the name of your tutorial with the verbs "Make", "Build", "Create", etc. The verb doesn't provide useful information to the user since they already know that they are looking to "make" or "build" something.

* Do: Wood table
* Don't: Make a wood table

##### 1.3 Specify the main material used, to clarify what your tutorial is about

* Prefer: Table made from oak and metal
* Rather than: Table in wood

### 2. If your tutorial concerns a technique:

##### 2.1 Always start with an infinitive verb that describes the technique.

##### 2.2 Do not start the name of your tutorial by the verbs "Learn", "How to", etc. The verb doesn't provide useful information to the user, since they already know that they are looking to "Learn" something.

* Prefer: Sand down a table
* Rather than: How to sand down a table

If a tutorial with the name you have entered already exists, you will be sent to the form for editing that tutorial.
