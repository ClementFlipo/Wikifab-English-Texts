<h4>Our mission</h4>

Wikifab empowers individuals to share their creative skills with the rest of the world.


<h4>How we do that?</h4>

We are developing an open source hardware documentation platform.


<h4>What kind of projects will be hosted on Wikifab?</h4>

We are creating a platform that is versatile for both simple low-tech projects and high-tech projects using complex engineering.


<h4>What can the platform do?</h4>

Wikifab is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to make almost anything. Anyone can create a tutorial for a project, and anyone can edit existing tutorials to improve them. We built our application to be powerful, flexible and intuitive so that you can focus on building and exploring your project.


<h4>What are the key features?</h4>

Tracking the history of tutorials allows effective collaboration. We are currently building the capability for users to propose or experiment with alternative tutorials that don't alter the original.


<h4>Why choose the open source model?</h4>

Because we believe in transparency. Anyone can download the Wikifab software, install it on their own server or improve it themselves. Wikifab will never claim ownership of the content our users create. 


<h4>Where can I download the code of Wikifab?</h4>

Wikifab source code isnâ€™t freely downloadable on Github yet. We need to clean it a little and organize it better to allow collaboration. However, if you want to help improve it today, just send us an email at team@wikifab.org and we'll send it over.
