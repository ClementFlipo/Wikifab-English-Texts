<h4>Our mission</h4>

Empower individuals to share their expertise and creativity with the world.

<h4>Our platform</h4>

Wikifab is a wiki-based site that teaches people how to make almost anything. The platform documents instructions for simple and technical projects.  You can create new tutorials for projects or make edits to current projects to enhance them. The platform is powerful, flexible and intuitive so that you can focus on building your project and exploring other exciting projects.


<h4>Key features</h4>

Tracking the history of tutorials allows for effective collaboration. We are currently building the capability for users to propose or experiment with alternative tutorials that don't alter the original.


<h4>Open source model</h4>

We believe in transparency. Our combined abilities make our projects more effective and more resilient.  Anyone can freely download the Wikifab software, install it on their own server or improve it themselves. Wikifab will never claim ownership of the content our users create.

<h4> Wikifab’s source code</h4>

Wikifab source code isn’t freely downloadable on Github yet. We need to enhance it further and optimize the platform to facilitate collaboration. However, if you want to help improve it today, just send us an email at team@wikifab.org and we'll send it over.
