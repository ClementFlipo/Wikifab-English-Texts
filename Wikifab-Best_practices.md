<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle-first">What to do on Wikifab?</h2>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Go for it!</h3>
<p>The survival and growth of any wiki requires participation. Wikifab is small and our success depends on the regular contributions of volunteers. Starting a new tutorial or improving an existing one is a thousand times better than doing nothing at all. The following are not rules, but guidelines. Even we sometimes forget to follow all of them, or go back and re-edit something if needed. We know we're all human, and that we make mistakes. The tutorials will get better over time, so don't feel like everything has to be done perfectly the first time. Don't be scared, any changes you make that turn out badly can be reverted easily. Be a pioneer!</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Take great photos</h3>
<p>Excellent photos are the number one thing that will draw people to make the object fo your tutorial. Taking excellent photos is totally possible with inexpensive equipment. Take some time prior to your shoot to study our photo tutorials.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Be descriptive</h3>
<p>Vague words like "thing," "part," and "stuff" lead to ambiguous tutorials. If you don't know what something is called, do your best to identify it by Googling or asking someone. Gadgets may have several intricate internal parts -- calling a part "this thing" doesn't help anyone.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Link your tutorials with others</h3>
<p>Link your tutorials with another could be very useful. For example, if, to make your object, the user needs to perform a technique that is describe in another tutorial, just link your tutorial with this on and don't try to explain a technic inside your tutorial. Clic here to learn how to insert a link in your tutorial.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Write simple sentences, not loquacious</h3>
<p>People will not use your repair manual if they cannot understand what you're talking about.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Use the appropriate bullet marker</h3>
<p>You can create a ton of confusion by using bullets inappropriately. Donate a second and read up on each bullet's meaning before using it. When in doubt, use the default!</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok indisp-icon-ok"></span>Be bold!</h3>
<p>Wikis like our develop faster when everybody helps to fix problems, correct grammar, add facts, make sure wording is accurate, etc. We would like everyone to be bold and help make Wikifab a better platform.</p>

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">What NOT to do on Wikifab?</h2>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove indisp-icon-nok"></span>Don't mention brands</h3>
<p>Wikifab wants to remain free from advertising. Stay neutrally and never cite a brand of tool or material unless this product of this specific brand is mandatory to make the object of your tutorial.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove indisp-icon-nok"></span>Don't engage in personal attacks, even when you disagree</h3>
<p>You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to criticize ideas, not people. Please avoid:
* Name-calling.
* Ad hominem attacks.
* Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
* Knee-jerk contradiction.
Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation. Respect your fellow Wikifabians, even when you disagree. Seek consensus and avoid edit wars. Act in good faith, and assume good faith on the part of others. Be open and welcoming to newcomers.</p>
<h3 class="apprendre-subtitle"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove indisp-icon-nok"></span>Don't post someone else's content</h3>
<p>Post only your own stuff. You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.</p>
