<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle-first">Licenses proposed on Wikifab</h2>

When you publish a tutorial on Wikifab, you are subject to two different licenses.

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">License on the instructions</h2>

"Instructions" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text, and other explanatory material that make the tutorial.

By publishing a tutorial on Wikifab you choose to freely distribute your instructions under Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike (CC BY-SA). This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work even for commercial purposes, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.

This is the license used on Wikipedia.

<h2 class="contribuer-subtitle">License on the objects</h2>

"Object" means either an entire, or any part of a, device built using the Instructions or the modified Instructions.

Today (January 2015), you can choose to distribute your projets among one of three following free licenses:

* Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
* Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)
* CERN Open Hardware Licence v1.2

FYI, we are also considering adding the TAPR Open Hardware License and the GNU Free Hardware Designs License. What do you think of them ?

So whatever the chosen license, any creation derived from the object of your tutorial can be used for commercial purposes.


<h4>Might I lose my content if someone makes an undesirable change?</h4>

No! Whatever the changes made, all versions of all the tutorials are logged and can be retrieved.

Moreover, when checking the "Watch this page" box at the bottom of the modification page of a tutorial, you can track changes made by another contributor. You can then discuss with the community on the discussion page if you think that the modifications are not relevant.


<h4>What is my interest in publishing my tutorials under these licenses?</h4>

Today, most of the knowledge required to make a product are inaccessible by their complexity or are "protected" by patents. By sharing freely the documentation of your product, you allow citizens to make things by themselves and no longer depend on a particular industry. The inventions of mankind belong to all!

Moreover, even if you are the best engineer in the world, sharing your recipes enable collaboration and improve your product.

If you're still not convinced, we invite you to watch this video with Nathan Seidle of SparkFun Electronics explaining the principles and challenges of open source hardware well better than us!
